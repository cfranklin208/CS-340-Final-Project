# CS-340-Final-Project
How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? Especially consider your work on the CRUD Python module from Project One, which you used to connect the dashboard widgets to the database in Project Two. What were the advantages of working in this way? How else could you use this CRUD Python module in the future?

To write maintainable programs, modularity and simplicity are vital. Creating code that is commented well allows future programmers to easily update and modify your code. Using modularity such as creating middleware that interfaces with multiple items makes the code more maintainable and reusable. 

How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist? Consider how you approached the database or dashboard requirements that Grazioso Salvare requested. How did your approach to this project differ from previous assignments in other courses? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to create databases to meet other client requests?

Approaching a problem as a computer scientist means thinking about the simplest answers to the most difficult problems. I approached this project differently than I have other projects in that modularity was a huge part of the process. 

What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter? How would your work on this type of project help a company, like Grazioso Salvare, to do their work better?

Computer scientists do many things in their careers. The biggest job of all though is to take someone's ideas and problems and find a solution. This project was a perfect example of this because I took the problem of having too much data and no way of sorting through it, to a simple user interface that allows the user to easily view and filter the data.
